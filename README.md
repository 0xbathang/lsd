# Logos Design System

## Introduction

LSD is a open-source design system for products and digital experiences in counter culture. Based on the Logos collective guidelines and principles, we are removing unnecessary visual design layers and logic. We are enabling people with decentralising design and placing value on accessibility and information.
Our aim is to reduce visual elements in implementation, resulting in an approach that offsets the current web design world (2.0 or 3.0).

## Theming

LSD offers two unique themes, each with its approach to design.

<br/>

### Radical Theme

The "Radical Theme" is a minimalistic and unified design system that challenges the status quo with visual polarization and empowers the user to think outside the box.

### Anarcho-Default theme (not available)

The "Anarcho-Default" theme is more radical in approach. It eliminates the need for extra data and downloads by adopting the native built-in design for each component and element. This theme is a true expression of the message being the message, as it works in any environment without the need for additional design elements.
